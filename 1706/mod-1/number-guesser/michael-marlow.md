## Student: Michael Marlow
## Evaluator: Meeka
## Notes/What To Work On:

#### Major Errors:

Modal for rules, which is not working. Fixed some bugs during eval but not all - be sure to make sure that the main functionality and comp matching is locked down before moving on to extra features. Advice to do extra features on a branch, changes the dynamic when they are half complete during and eval/client meeting/etc

#### Minor Issues that would be fixed in the next iteration:

Can submit an ‘e’ to the form - will get caught on enter but not on clicking guess - when able to submit registers as NaN and logs a winner. - fixed response during eval.

Can set a min and max out of acceptable ranges like a min above or below

#### Comp Mismatching

- Spacing on top banner is off significantly - removing the 12.5vh on the header seems to fix it
    - student thinks it’s because changing the rest of the body 
- Enter your guess placeholder off on right side
- Thinner font width in the buttons
- Watch capitalization - for example ‘Your guess was too Low’

#### Cleanup notes 

- console.logs left in the codebase
- click listener is set on the whole body - consider a workflow that doesn't set the whole body aflame
- General comments, spacing, etc
