## Notes/What To Work On:

Great first project 

Keep an eye on spacing, etc. Already a strong effort there though. Think about removing comments in your workflow slowly in places where the code is clear enough to tell its own story.

High level, think about function names and make sure that they encompass all of the functionality - so for example if you clear a button AND disable buttons, make sure the function name doesn't make it sound like you only do one thing

Keep on keeping on, great approach to refacting on all levels
