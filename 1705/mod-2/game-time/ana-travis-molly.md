## Functional Expectations

* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

### User Interface

Make sure button to reset matches style

Need some stylistic indication of the win and loss to drag the eye to it

* 3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

### Code Sanitation

The output from eslint showsâ€¦

* 4 - Zero complaints
