Nice work!

------------------------------------------------------------------

## Rubric

### Functional Expectations

|Proficient         | The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. |


------------------------------------------------------------------

## HTML

#### Accessibility

|Proficient         | Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns. |

#### Style

|Advanced Beginner  | Crafts markup with proper and logical nesting. |
|Proficient         | Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices. |


------------------------------------------------------------------

## CSS

#### Structure of Code

|Advanced Beginner  | Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.|
|Proficient         | Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS. |

#### Implementation

|Advanced Beginner  | Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.|
|Proficient         | Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout. |


------------------------------------------------------------------

## JAVASCRIPT

#### Data Types

|Advanced Beginner  | Can diagnose when issues of data-type mismatch are present and appropriately redirect their coding and/or research efforts accordingly to solve the problem.|
|Proficient         | Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.|

#### Conditional Logic

|Advanced Beginner  | Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is "truthy" and "falsey" in JavaScript.|
|Proficient         | Can use an if/else statement to effectively handle multiple paths through the code. Writes if/else statements that only have one level of logic (no nesting). Can use logical operators instead of if/else statements where applicable.|

#### Functions & Scope

|Advanced Beginner  | Developer is comfortable using multiple arguments to pass data into functions. Understands how variables are scoped at the function level and global level. Functions are named descriptively. Knows when and why to use return in a function.|
|Proficient         | Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.|

#### Arrays

|Advanced Beginner  | Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.|
|Proficient         | Does not use for loops for arrays - uses array prototypes, such as forEach, to iterate through or manipulate arrays. Can use array to store more complicated data structures such as objects or nested arrays. Is comfortable/efficient with reading array prototype documentation and can efficiently test/apply array prototype methods they have not worked with before.|

#### Objects & Prototypes

|Advanced Beginner  | Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.|
|Proficient         | Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the "why" of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.|

#### DOM Manipulation

|Advanced Beginner  | Can add event listeners and create small functions that execute on events, can leverage the event object appropriately, and can articulate the what/why/how of jQuery.|
|Proficient         | Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.|

#### Style

|Advanced Beginner  | Code shows strong effort toward organization, but suffers from long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and requires significant refactoring. Application may have some duplication and minor bugs. |
|Proficient         | Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.|


------------------------------------------------------------------

## GIT & GITHUB

#### Git

|Advanced Beginner  | Can create branches and willingly attempts to incorporate branches into their workflow. Commits, while infrequent, are increased in volume and show improvements in description. |
|Proficient         | Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.|

#### Github

|Advanced Beginner  | Can execute basic pull requests with context about changes in description. Can keep local and GitHub repositories in sync.|
|Proficient         | Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.|


------------------------------------------------------------------

## DESIGN

#### Comp Recreation

|Advanced Beginner  | Can accomplish about 50-75% of the large and small design details and can logically rework them on at least 1 breakpoint. |
|Proficient         | Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.|


------------------------------------------------------------------

## PAIRING

#### Collaboration

|Advanced Beginner  | Can identify deltas in skill level and collaborate on methods whereby both pairs can share equitably in the workload. Can revisit the DTR to address changes that arise, and/or simply to keep one another reminded of the working plan.|
|Proficient         | Can diplomatically handle issues that arise between the pair through respectful, focused, targeted feedback and implement changes to positively adapt the working relationship and keep the project on track. Can effectively implement tactics to support their partner's learning and project goals, while also honoring their own personal learning and project goals, should the two be different or at different levels due to skill delta. |
