### Reviewer: Bree
### Notes: 
Students may take the weekend and resubmit project for review on Monday for revised scores.

### Functional Expectations
- 1: Application does not meet the requirements in Phase One.

### Fundamental JavaScript Style
- 2: Application runs but the code has long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring.

### Workflow
- 2.5: The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.

### HTML Style
- 3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

### CSS Style
- 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.
