## Component Architecture

* 3.5 - Application is broken in out into at least 6 components that properly encapsulate functionality. There is no more than one component that could be broken down into composite parts.

## User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
