### Evaluator: Bree
Anna has progressed quite a bit in her grasp of javascript. I would like to see improvement in ability to break out code into logical components more quickly. Not just from a function perspective, but specifically faster on leveraging variables correctly and as a helpful piece to break the problem into steps.

Use of pseudo code is good, but could use some improvement in breaking down into even smaller steps.

### Progression/Completion

* 2.5: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of an apprentice.

### JavaScript Style

* 2.5: Developer writes effective code, but does not breakout logical components

### Workflow

* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

### Collaboration

* 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck
