ShutUp&Dance

I am building a small-scale version music app that provides the user with options to find a local venue where a particular artist is going to play at.  

Project Status

I'm currently hitting the Spotify artist image endpoint and  rendering them.  

I'm barelyyyy authorizing a user via express.

Installation and Setup Instructions

Clone down this repository. You will need node and npm installed globally on your machine.  To start front end, npm run end. back To start backend, npm run backend.  Then bring up http://localhost:8080


What was the context for this project? (ie: was this a side project? was this for Turing? was this for an experiment?)
What did you set out to build?
Why was this project challenging and therefore a really good learning experience?

I plan on working on this project well after the deadline for Turing.  There are many features that require more than the time allotted for this project.  Originally, I had intended on making geolocation the primary tool in finding the user, locating local artists at venues, and then pulling in a sample of their music from Spotify.

At, this point I want to build a small scale version of Spotify.

Ideally, I'd love to end up in music development.  Not only is the project something I'm mildly obsessed with, but I believe it is a project that would benefit my to present to, hopefully, future employers.
What were some unexpected obstacles?
What tools did you use to implement this project?
This might seem obvious because you are IN this codebase, but to all other humans now is the time to talk about why you chose webpack instead of create react app, or D3, or vanilla JS instead of a framework etc. Brag about your choices and justify them here.

This project utilizes a backend with express node, and front end built with React-Redux and Router.
  Complications arose when trying to pull in api data that required OAtuth.  I'm please to report I'm now pulling that data in.
