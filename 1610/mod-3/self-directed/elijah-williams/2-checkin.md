Student: Elijah Williams

Check In: 2

Project Name: Neumann's Assistant

Client: Turing students

Deliverables:

Now that you have started building your app, what are the frameworks/additional modules/technologies/testing frameworks you are using, list those here (ALL of them).

- React
- Router
- Mongo
- Redux 

Based on the MVP you stated in the first check in template, list what you have accomplished, and what still needs to be done.

What I've accomplished: 

1. I've got a file structure set up for Redux with actions, containers, and reducers
2.  Mongo is set up with databases for both companies and users
3. I've got a super basic companies and cities page that pulls elements from the  database and renders them on their respective page 

What I still need to accomplish:

1. I need to allow users to enter data about companies
2. I'll need to set up the login page and be able talk to the database
3. CSS
4. Add search feature
5. Decide on how to implement cities browsing (do I want a seperate button?)

The next check in will be Monday/Tuesday. Based on unexpected challenges and/or unexpected progress adjust your MVP to reflect what you can get done by your next check in.

I hope to have all of the above features set up by then.  I'm not sure if I'll get to the D3 feature.  

What is on fire/what are you having trouble with?

I'm still not really comfortable with Redux, so I feel like I'm moving slow with it.
