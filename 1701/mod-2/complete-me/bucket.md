# Comments:

### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring


### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 3:  Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Functional Expectations
// implement select --> 3
// move dictionary to test
* 2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints
