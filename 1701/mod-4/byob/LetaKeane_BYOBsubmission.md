# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/letakeane/faceEmotionAPI/blob/master/server.js#L253-L265)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
I had a lot of fun writing (hopefully) helpful error messages.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/letakeane/faceEmotionAPI/blob/master/server.js#L110-L168)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
This code works well, but is not modular. I also want to be able to implement chainable queries (like `api/v1/emotions/3?gender=2+?race=2`).

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

It might just be the adrenaline backwash after staying up very late last night, but I'm feeling very positively about this project. It was a nice mix of challenging and achievable. There were moments when I felt frustrated, but I never felt completely at sea. It was also just really nice to get to pair with you guys (even on solving my very dumb syntax errors).
