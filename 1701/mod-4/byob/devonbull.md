# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/DBULL7/VoterData/blob/master/server/router.js)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

I was able to use multiple controllers and make each controller file responsible only for it's corresponding routes.
It's something that's been bugging me for weeks and to finally do it felt great. 

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/DBULL7/VoterData/blob/master/server/controllers/districtController.js#L66-L79)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

It had to be dynamic to set/update or delete a key value pair on a mongodb record. 
I got it to work but it just looks awful to me.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

Anything else you wanna say

MongoDB almost proved to be more than I can handle but I made it. Older, with more battle scars, not sure about wiser. 
Definitely made me appreciate the simplicity of SQL databases. Thanks for letting me run with it, I've been 
dreaming about taking huge amounts raw data and sculpting it into something useful for a couple of years now. 
Feels great to have finally done it.
