# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/kellymiller6/byob/blob/master/test/routes.spec.js#L433-L451)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

Honestly not that proud of any of my code, it's all super repetitive and needs to be
refactored. This test was perhaps my favorite problem I solved.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/kellymiller6/byob/blob/master/test/routes.spec.js#L288-L299)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
All my sad path tests need to be more thorough and my error messages that go along with them.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
