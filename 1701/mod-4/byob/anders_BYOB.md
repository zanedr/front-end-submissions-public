# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/anderswood/byob/blob/master/server.js#L118-L144)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?
###### This code adds a lot of functionality with minimal lines of code- the user can query any of the column heading because the code dynamically pulls in their query

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/anderswood/byob/blob/master/server.js#L227-L248)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
##### I think these parameters are a little confusing for the user to input, could be easier, maybe with a custom search

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

Anything else you wanna say
-Not my favorite project... don't enjoy hanging out in the backend so much, but very satisfying when the endpoints do work in Postman
