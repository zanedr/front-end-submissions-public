Yes

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[happy code]()

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

I'm actually really proud of the entire project. I really wasn't understanding the concepts we've covered and although this project was a struggle, especially with CircleCI and Heroku (since this was the first time I did that), I am very happy that I got most things to work and have a pretty thorough understanding of what's going on.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/hilvitzs/byob/blob/master/server.js#L104-L116)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

While I think that this will work for one query, I was confused as to how to extend that to multiple query parameters. I was happy that I thought of the object.keys and checking to see if they're there and using that for the select(), but I know that it's not completely functional and could be written better.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

I am feeling a lot better about everything with this project, as well as with the extra Jet Fuel practice. I know that I could have done a little bit more testing but just understanding the basics of everything that I'm doing is a great, new feeling.

My token for this project is: 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6ImpvaG4iLCJwYXNzd29yZCI6InNtaXRoIiwiaWF0IjoxNTAwMDE1MzY0LCJleHAiOjE1MDA2MjAxNjR9.dtGXeHB_1AxqPBByPDgJEYxgenurmgH7TQLceB_qWAI';
