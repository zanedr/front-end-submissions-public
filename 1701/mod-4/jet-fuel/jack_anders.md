## Completion

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/anderswood/jetfuel/blob/master/public/javascript.js#L87-L102)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

This sort function consolidates a lot of the sorting functionality into a few, slick lines.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/anderswood/jetfuel/blob/master/public/helper.js#L1-L18)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

The code is very coupled/nested and therefore hard to follow, debug and test. It was really challenging to get it to work in the first place so that was the focus of creating the block.  

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
