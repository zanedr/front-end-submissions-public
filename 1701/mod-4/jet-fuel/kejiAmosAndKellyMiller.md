## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

No we were able to complete all functionality on the project except for sorting my number of clicks. We did not finish this
part of the project because we were unable to get the clicks to increment properly until Friday morning.

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[happy code](<img width="1280" alt="screen shot 2017-06-30 at 12 58 43 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24981999/27750164-e22c5260-5d93-11e7-8867-082af9496db3.png">)

* cleaned up our code by breaking out queries and endpoints.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[sad code](<img width="864" alt="screen shot 2017-06-30 at 12 53 32 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24981999/27750012-3d7951be-5d93-11e7-91c1-4899fc4e75a0.png">)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
This one block of code seems to be handling a lot by putting the responsibility of updating clicks in 
the same get as the short url. Would have liked to break the clicks into a PUT but was unsuccessful. It also broke two tests.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
