#### Project Pitch  
An App that condenses the most popular news articles from over 70 different sources. Users can make comments, save it, upvote/downvote articles/news sources, and score it on a variety of factors like if it leaned towards being conservative or liberal or trustworthy or untrustworthy. News sources can be judged later in search criteria by these factors and by popularity/controversial/most talked about
### Deliverables  

#### APIs:  
https://newsapi.org

#### Wireframes  
check mockup folder.

#### Stack
Redux, React, Express, node.js

#### Waffle.io
Link to your waffle.io account with at least 10 cards indicating baby steps to how you want to structure your attack.  

### Reflection  

#### Order Of Attack  
1.) Finish the backend portion setup.
2.) App working with Api call from news-api
3.) App updating backend database
4.) App utilizing backend database for search criteria that renders list differently
5.) stats shown on card
6.) Setup React Router
7.) User Sign-in/log-in/log-out
8.) Setup Articles to be saved
9.) setup comment section
10.) visual effects of stats on card


### MVP
Backend basically 

#### Nice To Haves   
visual indication of articles or sources on how liberal/conservative/trustworthy they are

#### Biggest Challenges  
creating a database for use for this app
