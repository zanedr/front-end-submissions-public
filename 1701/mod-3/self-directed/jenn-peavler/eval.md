### Project Scope

A good project idea should:

* Break down into logical iterations so that you can deliver a strong product on every check-in
* Be something that real people would want to use to solve a problem
* Have enough *technical* challenge to be worth your time (as opposed to a *content* challenge)

### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

* 4: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set in check-ins in timely manner.

**2. Organization**

* 4: Developer used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.

### Technical Quality

**1. Test-Driven Development**

* 3: Project shows adequate testing (90% - 95% coverage).

Note: Coverage of outside functions

**2. Code Quality**

* 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality, proper abstractions, and reduced duplication.

### Product Experience

**1. User Experience**

* 3: Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.

**2. Performance**

Page loads quickly - Getting lat and long from Google is delayed
Recommendation of a spinner or loading icon

But after page is loaded initially, location is stashed and the app is fast to move around in

* 3: Project pages load on average under 500 milliseconds.
