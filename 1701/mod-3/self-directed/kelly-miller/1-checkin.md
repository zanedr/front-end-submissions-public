### Student: Kelly Miller

### Project Name:  Our Children - Foster Care Binder

#### Check In: 1  

#### Collaborators:  
Are you working with anyone else? - No

#### Project Pitch  
An app for foster parents to organize all the information for case-workers, children, and bio families
that the receive.
Includes a calendar for keeping track of visits, contact logs, and behavioral struggles/milestones.
Maybe a map program that allows foster parents to set up visits with bio family based of public transit.
### Deliverables  

#### Stack:
Firebase for backend - IQrypt for sensitive data
React or React Native?
React Router 4


#### APIs:  
For map feature - I would likely use BART api because it is well known and easy to access
[bart api](http://api.bart.gov/api/sched.aspx?cmd=arrive&orig=ASHB&dest=CIVC&date=now&key=MW9S-E7SL-26DU-VV8V&b=2&a=2&l=1)

#### Wireframes  
Include screenshots to wireframes or comps of **EVERY PAGE** of the MVP of your app. You can include these by adding additional files to your submissions directory, or linking to an imgur account. You're asked to use Sketch, or Balsamiq, or a different digital wireframe/comp application but if you choose to use pen/paper please let your instructors know and bring those to class Monday.

#### Waffle.io
Link to your waffle.io account with at least 10 cards indicating baby steps to how you want to structure your attack.

### Reflection  

#### Order Of Attack  
Based on your wireframes, in what order are you going to approach building out this application?
-Research firebase and encryption
-build backend using Firebase
-opening login/create account page
-create account and log in page
-parent profile
-children profile page -- bio-family pop out page
-calendar
-integrating calendar and contact logs on children bio

#### MVP
-Parent and child profile pages
-interactive calendar for events

#### Nice To Haves   
-Behavioral log through calendar that shows up on childs profile
-contact log through calendar that shows up on childs profile
-map features

#### Biggest Challenges  
What do you forsee being the biggest challenges of this project? List at least 3 resources you've thought of to help overcome these challenges.
1. Learning about encryption and safety for an app like this that will hold sensitive data
[iqrypt with firebase](http://iqrypt.com/blog/2016/05/13/searchable-encryption-applied-to-firebase-database/)
also firebase docs
2. Creating an interactive calendar

3. Learning and using React Native and Router with React Native
