Are you working with anyone else?

- my mentor

#### Project Pitch  

I want to build an application that allows people to visualize their bucket lists.  I want to pull in a map from Google Maps and allow people to place pins on the map based on where they want to travel and what they want to do.  Life is too short to spend the whole thing in a basement!

### Deliverables  

- I'm hoping to get familiar with the Google Maps API, how to setup a backend, and data visualization.

- I really want the application to look good, style is important.  I want to be able to be noticed instantly when someone pulls the site up.

#### Stack:
A map API (Google Maps or Map Box), a backend (Express), data visualization [(D3)](http://www.reactd3.org/)

#### APIs:  

[Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/)
[Weather Almanac](http://dataapi.wxc.com/almanac.html)
[Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.geo.photosForLocation.html)

#### Wireframes  
Include screenshots to wireframes or comps of **EVERY PAGE** of the MVP of your app. You can include these by adding additional files to your submissions directory, or linking to an imgur account. You're asked to use Sketch, or Balsamiq, or a different digital wireframe/comp application but if you choose to use pen/paper please let your instructors know and bring those to class Monday.

### Reflection  

#### Order Of Attack  
Based on your wireframes, in what order are you going to approach building out this application?

##### MVP setup

1. get data on map
2. get location data from user input
3. let user input a dream to map
4. have dream go to database
5. user can got to page that displays all dreams
6. user can filter by completed status of dreams
7. when filtered, only appropriate pins show on map
8. user can delete dream :(
9. graphs display visualizing status of completed dreams

##### Nice to Haves

1. user can input dates for almanac
2. almanac displays Weather

3. users can select and filter by region

4. something with heat map?

#### MVP

- Users can create an account
- Data points are listed on map
- Users can add new dream.  
- Users can stay logged in with local storage
- Users can display a list of all dreams

#### Nice To Haves   
What are your reach features?

- display weather almanac data to allow users to know when to go
- display heat map of data
- display pictures of lat and long with api data from flickr


#### Biggest Challenges  

What do you forsee being the biggest challenges of this project? List at least 3 resources you've thought of to help overcome these challenges.

###### Challenges

1. having to work with a backend/Express

2. Google maps docs are for vanilla JS, project will be in React

3. Staying focused and having proper structure/direction

###### resources

1. my mentor who has full stack experience and experience with maps

2. youtube and Anders/Bucket who are also using the Google maps API

3. Trello/Waffle/GitHub issues for organization
