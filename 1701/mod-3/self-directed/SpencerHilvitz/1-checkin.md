### Project Name:  

amirite?

#### Check In: 1  

#### Collaborators:  
Are you working with anyone else?

No.

#### Project Pitch  
I am creating an App in which people can upload an issue or an argument and then other people can vote on whose side they agree with. I am planning on bringing in some news API's as well so that people can vote on whether or not they agree with the article. 

### Deliverables  

#### Stack:

Redux, React, Router

#### APIs:  
Links to any API docs that you have decided to use

Associated Press API - https://developer.ap.org/ap-content-api

#### Wireframes  
Include screenshots to wireframes or comps of **EVERY PAGE** of the MVP of your app. You can include these by adding additional files to your submissions directory, or linking to an imgur account. You're asked to use Sketch, or Balsamiq, or a different digital wireframe/comp application but if you choose to use pen/paper please let your instructors know and bring those to class Monday.

### Reflection  

#### Order Of Attack  
Based on your wireframes, in what order are you going to approach building out this application?

First and foremost, I would like to delve into the user experience. I want to figure out the best flow possible so that finding information and voting is always easy.

Next I would like to get the API call working so I can add different categories, beyond the submit a question.

I would like to pull the pictures from the articles so that those can go on the site.

If possible I would like to get a user logged in and change their ability to add or delete questions which will require a database.

I might look into local-storage as well to store votes and/or questions.

#### MVP

A well-styled app that renders questions and a working slider scale that shows the amount of votes that people have on that comment. I would like the vote to work consistent across all pages where that particular question can be viewed.

#### Nice To Haves   
What are your reach features? Ie: "Web Sockets & 3D Animations!"

#### Biggest Challenges  
What do you foresee being the biggest challenges of this project? List at least 3 resources you've thought of to help overcome these challenges.

I think Redux will be one of my biggest challenges. I also think that having the user be able to add and delete only some questions will be difficult as well. The docs and previous projects will be helpful for that aspect. I am also using a tutorial on Redux that I think will be helpful.
