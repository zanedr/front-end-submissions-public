#### Wireframes  
I'm going for a simple panel based usage, I beleive these following frames are enough for MVP but I won't hesitate to add more panels as needed.


##### Voting Page

#### Waffle.io
https://waffle.io/zkc/Lunch-r
I've started my "plan of attack" on Trello, I'll migrate to Waffle

### Reflection  

#### Order Of Attack  
I want to poke about with websockets first. If that feels right I'll build up the Voting/suggestions page first. Then I'll work thru the group creation process.  

#### Nice To Haves   
I really want basic user account/profile functions 

#### Biggest Challenges  
The places data could be tricky. The googs docs got seem good. 
I've no clue how the backend voting sessions will be handled. I know they can, websocket exploration should help start spelling that end of things out.  
Dynamic URL generation. Each group voting session will need a unique URL. Probably not hard. Probably?
