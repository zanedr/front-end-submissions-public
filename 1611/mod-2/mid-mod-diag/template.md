* 2: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of an apprentice.
* 1: Developer struggles to implement solutions at the speed of an apprentice.
* 0: Developer is not able to implement basic functionality.

### JavaScript Style

* 4: Developer writes code that is exceptionally clear and well-factored
* 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components
* 2: Developer writes effective code, but does not breakout logical components
* 1: Developer writes code with unnecessary variables, operations, or steps which do not increase clarity
* 0: Developer writes code that is difficult to understand


### Workflow

* 4: Developer is a master of their tools, efficiently moving between phases of development
* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts
* 2: Developer smoothly moves between tools, but is dependent on mouse-driven interaction
* 1: Developer gets work done, but wastes significant time or screen real estate
* 0: Developer struggles to effectively use the Terminal, the file system, or their editor without direct support


### Collaboration

* 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck
* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process
* 2: Developer asks detailed questions when progress slows or stops
* 1: Developer is able to integrate unsolicited feedback but does not really collaborate
* 0: Developer needs more than two reminders to "think out loud" or struggles to articulate their process

### Testing

* 4: Developer excels at taking small steps and using the tests for both design and verification
* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design
* 2: Developer uses and writes tests to guide development, but implements more functionality than the tests cover
* 1: Developer is able to use existing tests, but not write new ones
0: Developer does not use tests to guide development
