## Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

### 1. Fundamental Javascript & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Javascript syntax, style, and refactoring.
* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.
* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring.
* 1:  Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution.

### 2. Enumerable & Collections

* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods
* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
* 2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques
* 1: Application demonstrates deficiencies with Enumerable and struggles with collections

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data.
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.
* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient given projet requirements.
* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD.

### 4. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility.
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.
* 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear.
* 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together.

### 5. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application fulfills all expectations of iterations 1 - 5 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality *as well as* an extensions.
* 3: Application fulfills expectations of iterations 1 - 5 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality.
* 2: Application is usable but has some missing functionality.
* 1: Application crashes during normal usage.
