# Instructor Evaluation Points: Sorting Sweet
# Instructor: yung-jhun
# Comments:

### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components


* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
