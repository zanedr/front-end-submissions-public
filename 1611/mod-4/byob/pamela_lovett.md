# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[Code I'm proud of](https://github.com/thatPamIAm/build_your_own_be/blob/development/server.js#L101-L112)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

I'm proud that I was able to get the custom endpoint working, especially after having to use custom endpoints to hit the API I wanted for my project.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[Meh code](https://github.com/thatPamIAm/build_your_own_be/blob/development/server.js#L146-L160)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

I couldn't get my test for this endpoint to pass, which I believe has something to do with my using a unique column in my primary table as the foreign key in my secondary - as this is what the error continuously points to as being wrong.
