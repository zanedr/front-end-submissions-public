# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[Link to code block in repo - Testing for server-side](https://github.com/becs919/jet-fuel/blob/37aeda6718b027f94f5a93ba408cd0a5cf7b5f0b/server.js)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

We're really proud that we set up our testing environment and wrote sad/happy tests for all endpoints - especially with how new all of this is.  

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[Link to code block in repo - 2nd migration](https://github.com/becs919/jet-fuel/tree/master/db/migrations)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

We felt great that Brittany had us make a new migration even though it scared us, but now we know how to do it. We weren't proud that we named our columns with dashes at first resulting in us having to make a new migration. We learned to never use dashes in column names. 

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.
