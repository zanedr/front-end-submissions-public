## Notes:
Struggled to divide work as a pair, the weight of the project fell to Megan.

### Functional Expectations

* 4 - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors

### User Interface

* 3.5 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor _without_ guidance from the developer.

### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

### Code Sanitation
No JSHint in the project code, they tested in the JSHint browser interface. It's ok.
