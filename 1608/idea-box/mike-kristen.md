Notes: Kristen did the lion's share of the work.

## Specification Adherence
3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

## User Interface
3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

## JavaScript Style
3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

## Workflow
3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
