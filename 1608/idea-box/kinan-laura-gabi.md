1 - The application is missing 3 or more smaller features or 1 major feature essential to having a complete application.
0 - The application is unusable.

## User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
2 - The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is not effective. The evaluator has some difficulty using the application when reviewing the features in the user stories.
