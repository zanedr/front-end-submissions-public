# Refactor Track Submission Form

## Basics

[Original Project Spec](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/refacktor-track.html)

### Summarize the work you completed over the last week
Over the last week, I did the following classes/learning some fundamental JavaScript problems and attended lessons on ESLint, making an NPM module, and Git hooks. For professional development, I had a google hangout interview, applied to a remote job and sent follow-up email, had a coffee meeting, and attended Joan Clarke coffee. For coding/programming, I refactored JetFuel, my personal site, Real Time, and FlixFaves. I also completed the static comp challenge and paired with Meeka.

### Summarize the meetings or pairing sessions you completed this week

I had two pairings with Meeka for refactoring and a meeting with Jessica West
to discuss professional opportunities and advice. I also attended the Joan
Clarke meeting this week and had a google hangout interview with Narwhal Digital.

### Summarize your experience logging hours this week.

I enjoyed using Harvest to track my hours this week.

### Link to the Documentation you completed for the week

I would say my documentation is this submission form and tracking my hours.
Let me know if there needs to be something additional.

### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups

I liked this experience and hearing what people were working on. I think it
could have been improved by having it every day including Wednesday and if
everyone doing the track would have been there each day. Not having everyone there or everyday made it feel a little disjointed.

### Discuss: one negative to this style of project

One negative is that everyone on the track is not working on the same thing so
it makes it somewhat difficult to collaborate.

### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.

There were several new things I learned about this week including how to break
out functions from React components, how to use git hooks, how to add and use
eslint files.

### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

I enjoyed this week. I thought it was a good change of pace and it allowed me to
revisit concepts that I had learned before but had not properly implemented or
understood. I wish I would have written a blog post. Going to try to do that this weekend/next week.

# Instructor Feedback

I enjoyed pairing with Meeka this week. I wish I would have scheduled some time
with Nathaniel, Bree, and/or Louisa.
