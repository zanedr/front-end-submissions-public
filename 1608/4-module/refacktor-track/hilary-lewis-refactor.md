### Discuss: your experience doing daily stand ups
I enjoyed daily stand ups and I would like to do that more often. It would be nice to make sure each stand up is more consice and short. It is nice to reflect on the day and set goals for the next day. 

### Discuss: one negative to this style of project
There were times when I was not sure if I needed to be somewhere at a certain time.

### Talk about something that you didn't know about before this week.
I did not know about a lot of the companies I reached out to and sent applications to. I also did not know how to set up Sass with Create React App and I was able to do that. I am excited that I got to complete my portfolio and refactor my ReadMe pages for all of the projects.

Couldn't do anything for the image - no actual image was linked there :(
