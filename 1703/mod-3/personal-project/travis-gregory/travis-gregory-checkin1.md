## Project Name:  the Lost

#### Check In: 1  

#### Project Pitch  

### Deliverables  

#### Stack:
- React, Redux, Router(maybe if necessary), victory.js, Enzyme/Jest

#### APIs:
- The link to my API is broken but I'm able to bring down the data files from [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/about-the-counted)
- [Google Maps Javascript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/)

#### Wireframes: Image included in file

#### Order Of Attack

- I'm planning on beginning by determining my necessary components and which will need redux containers. Then I'll build out the file structure. From there I need to figure out how to connect to my data. In the time in between I'm going to look in to how to implement D3.js in to my project to render the data on a visualizations page and the google maps javascript api to render a map that also renders data on map.

#### MVP

- My MVP will have a page that renders a filterable grid of the victims of fatal police encounters as well as a second page using router that uses D3 to visualize the data.

- Visualize data with googlemaps 

- Print report

#### Nice To Haves

- Multiple different visualizations that can be filtered by the user.
- Have images.

#### Biggest Challenges

- Implementing the google maps javascript api
- Implementing D3.js in to react/Redux
- Testing
