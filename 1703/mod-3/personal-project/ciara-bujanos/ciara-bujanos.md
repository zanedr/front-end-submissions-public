## Project Name:  Smitten Kitchen
#### Check In: 1  

#### Project Pitch  Smitten Kitchen : the ultimate recipe cooking guide. It can access thousands of recipes from the Spoonacular Recipe API and allows users to save their favorite recipes.

### Deliverables  

#### Stack:  React, Redux, maybe backend, havent received API yet?

#### APIs:  https://spoonacular.com/food-api   if time integrate IBM Watson text to speech https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/text-to-speech.html

#### Wireframes:  http://imgur.com/a/fFUcT

#### Waffle & Github:  https://waffle.io/buji405/smitten-kitchen    https://github.com/buji405/smitten-kitchen

#### Order Of Attack:  probably hook up the search bar, then work on login, logout, routing, finally save recipe button.

#### MVP:  

- user can search for a recipe by, cuisine, ingredients, and name of recipe.
- user can favorite recipes and view them. (not linked to the user)
- application is well tested
- tying everything to a user

#### Nice To Haves:

- ideally id like to incorporate a 'cooking mode' where you can have a text reader that reads recipes aloud as you cook.
- printing off the recipe
- ratings

#### Biggest Challenges: redux and backend if i need it.  

#### Deliverables for next checkin

- have boiler plate of front set up ( react, redux, router )
- have styles implemented
- if you get the API key back start making requests to get recipes
  - ideally search by name || cuisine easiest to knock out.
- look into [node.js]('http://frontend.turing.io/lessons/module-4/node.html') , [express]('http://frontend.turing.io/lessons/module-4/intro-to-express.html'), and [knex]('http://frontend.turing.io/lessons/module-4/knex-postgres.html')
