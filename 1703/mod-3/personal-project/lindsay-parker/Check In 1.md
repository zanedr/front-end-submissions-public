#### Order Of Attack  
##### Iteration 0 - Landing Page
 - The user should see a random representation of each major style by category
 - There should be buttons to view an individual style or category
 - There should be a button to view user favorites

##### Iteration 1 - By Style or Category
 - When the user clicks a button to view individual style or category, they should be brought to `/:style` or `/all/:category`
 - These routes should display a random assortment of representative cards

##### Iteration 2 - By Style & Category
 - When the user clicks on an individual card, they should be brought to `/:style/:category`
 - This route should display a random assortment of representative cards

##### Iteration 3 - Favorites
 - There should be a button on each card to save it to Favorites
 - `/favorites` shows only favorited cards
 - User should be able to delete a favorite
 - If there are no favorites, there should be a message indicating that there are no favorites

#### MVP
Grid of random category-by-style representations with ability to click style or category and bring up new representations

#### Nice To Haves
 - User favorites should persist
 - `/favorites` should show a calculated style tendency based on the users selected favorites
 - Search functionality
 - Filter functionality
 - Photo browser
 - Implement a `More` button on style and category pages
 - Clicking an item directs to ???

#### Biggest Challenges
 - Redux again
 - API Calls / Web Scraping
