## Project Name:  Smitten Kitchen 
#### Check In: 1  
  		  
#### Project Pitch  Smitten Kitchen : the ultimate recipe cooking guide. It can access thousands of recipes from the Spoonacular Recipe API and allows users to save their favorite recipes.
  		  
### Deliverables  
  		  
#### Stack:  React, Redux, maybe backend, havent received API yet? 
  		  
#### APIs:  https://spoonacular.com/food-api   if time integrate IBM Watson text to speech https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/text-to-speech.html

#### Waffle & Github:  https://waffle.io/buji405/smitten-kitchen    https://github.com/buji405/smitten-kitchen
  		  
#### Order Of Attack:  probably hook up the search bar, then work on login, logout, routing, finally save recipe button.
  		  
#### MVP:  be able to login, logout, broad search and save recipe. 
  		  
#### Nice To Haves: ideally id like to incorportate a 'cooking mode' where you can have a text reader that reads recipes aloud as you cook. 
  		  
#### Biggest Challenges: redux and backend if i need it.
