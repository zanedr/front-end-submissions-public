### Project Scope

A good project idea should:

* Break down into logical iterations so that you can deliver a strong product on every check-in
* Be something that real people would want to use to solve a problem
* Have enough *technical* challenge to be worth your time (as opposed to a *content* challenge)

### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

* 4: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set in check-ins in timely manner.
* 3: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set during check-ins.
* 2: Developer completed most of the user stories and requirements set during check-ins.
* 1: Developer completed the user stories and requirements partially.

**2. Organization**

* 4: Developer used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
* 3: Developer used a project management tool to keep their project organized.
* 2: Developer used a project management tool but didn't update the progress frequently.
* 1: Developer failed to use a project management tool to track its progress.

### Technical Quality

**1. Test-Driven Development**

* 4: Project shows exceptional use of testing at different layers (above 95% coverage).
* 3: Project shows adequate testing (90% - 95% coverage).
* 2: Project shows gaps in test usage/coverage/design (85 - 90% coverage).
* 1: Project lacks sufficient testing (under 85% coverage).

**2. Code Quality**

* 4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.
* 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality, proper abstractions, and reduced duplication.
* 2: Project demonstrates some gaps in code quality..
* 1: Project demonstrates poor factoring.
