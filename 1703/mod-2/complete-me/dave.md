# Instructor Evaluation Points: Complete-me
# Instructor: Limbo
# Comments:
* Front end is sick!
* Count not accounting for duplicates, try to get working correctly
* Look to be more consistent with style (i.e. "function" vs. arrow, spacing, semi colons, etc.)
  * polish it before evals
* remove comments explaining what code does, if you still need, move to separate branch. Master should be clean.
