Evaluator(s): Brenna
Group:  Jeff & Andy
Brenna's Notes:  
  Really great use of modular functions and breaking out functionality into tiny components. Opportunities to refactor large files, but arguments against why they chose not to speak to design decisions.

  Missing the visual cue for when the timer is almost up, but will refactor and finish by end of day for a 4.

  Strong implementation of TDD and attempts at integration testing. 

## Specification Adherence
<!-- will bump up if visual cue added by end of the day -->
<!-- 4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions. -->
3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.


## User Interface  

4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.
3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
2 - The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is not effective. The evaluator has some difficulty using the application when reviewing the features in the user stories.
1 - The application is confusing or difficult to use.  

## HTML Style

4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.
3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.
2: Developer writes effective HTML, but does not write semantically correct and clearly organized code. Application shows some effort to use semantically correct HTML, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear. There are many un-semantic tags and unnecessary selectors and it is not clear to the evaluator what a given section of code represents visually. Developer cannot speak to every line of code.
1: Developer writes code with unnecessary tags, selectors, or nesting which do not increase clarity. Developer writes code that is difficult to understand. Application markup shows poor structure with no understanding of semantics.  

## CSS/Sass Style

4: Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS/Sass with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.
3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.
2: Your application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.
1: Your application has a significant amount of duplication and one or more major bugs. Developer cannot speak to most choices and does not know what every line of CSS/Sass is doing. Developer writes code with unnecessary selectors or tags which do not increase clarity.  

## JavaScript Style

4 - Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components separated out into logical components. There zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

## Testing

4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels (feature and unit). The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application.

## Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

## Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…
4 - Zero complaints

## Design

4 - The application is visually appealing and shows thoughtful and effective use of typography, color, and layout. The application looks professional, with visuals enhancing the user’s experience. The evaluator has very few recommended changes.
3 - The application has a strong approach to layout and content hierarchy, but typography and color choices are lacking. The evaluator has several recommended changes to improvement.
2 - Layout, content hierarchy, typography, and color choices show effort, but the result is not effective. The evaluator recommends significant changes.
1 - Layout, content hierarchy, typography, and color choices actively detract from the user’s ability to use the application.
