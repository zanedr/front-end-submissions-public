# __Kinan Whyte - M4 - Front-End Portfolio__

### **_Areas of Emphasis_**

> During Module 4 I mainly set out to relax into my knowledge base by refining some Javascript fundamentals, but also remain open to learning an entirely flexible way to use JavaScript in its isomorphic sense, i.e. on the back-end and front-end. I felt great ending module 3 and felt like running out of the gates at the start of this module.

### A: End of Module Assessment

# Challenge: _GrudgeBin - JS: jQuery, Node, & Express

**Evaluation Comments:**<br>
### Evaluator: Alex Tideman
### Kinan Whyte

[Original Assignment](https://gist.github.com/Alex-Tideman/5b554a3c4812dc0dd0dc712f84ca5a95)
[Github Repository](https://github.com/kswhyte/160h8-grudge-bin)
[Live Version](https://grudge-bin-160h8.herokuapp.com/)

### Specification Adherence

* 3: The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 or more of the features outlined in the specification above. Application is in production.

Can sort by name and date correctly, can forgive and unforgive a person and can click on any's name to navigate to their page at any point. One UI bug remaining of not correctly updating count of forgiven vs. unforgiven.

### Javascript Syntax & Style

* 3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Some refactoring needed with big functions.

### Testing

* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design. Developer uses integration tests and a few unit tests where appropriate.

Client-side testing complete with unit tests on functionality to switch forgiveness and to test data of grudge list.

### CSS Style

*CSS is graded on quality, not quantity. You don't need a lot of CSS to have a pleasant interface*

* 4: Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

### Workflow

* 3.5: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

Great naming convention, just make sure to have super small, atomic commits.

---

> Work Ethic at Turing can be summed as follows: "ABC" - Always Be Coding.

> Turing highlights an educational approach in which an applicative discipline dominates. The number 1 Goal has been to get programming as much as possible. This is what occurred here in this module. I may have coded more than ever during my personal project, and have certainly spent the longest hours in a day working on projects.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

### **_Solo Projects_**

> Projects invited all students to test skills they didn't know they even had. Much of our learning was self-resourced through online components, community interaction, and experience in writing a lot of code. Often we were given lessons after our self-learning. This reinforced concepts and shed light on particular tools in a way that wouldn't be as beneficial otherwise.

# _RealTime_

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/real-time.html)
* [Live Version](https://poll-bui1der.herokuapp.com/polls)

**Description:**<br>

In this project, the chief aim was to explore client-side security with Auth0 and build a real-time application with communications to WebSockets. When the server gets new information, it pushes it out to all of the connected clients, who each authorize with a github account. A user will come to the web app to create a poll/question for whatever audience of choice using 4 options/answers to go with it. Then a user’s Github image will act as a marker to indicate when they have selected a poll option. All poll option selections update in real-time, and the poll 'admin' is able to specify an ending date and time.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### **_Team Projects_**

> Pairing with team members to work through implementing an idea from start to finish is essential for the growth of a software engineer. Approaches to writing and building software may bode well in the land of one, but our true skills and prose were tested under the fires of approaches and perspectives colliding during group projects. Communication skills, workflow, strengths, and work styles all mixed and mingled. Many gems were born under these temperatures.

# _Jet Fuel_

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hilarylewis92/jetFuel)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/jet-fuel.html)
* [Live Version](https://jetfuelshortener.herokuapp.com/)

**Description:**<br>
This application allows users to create folders (like bookmark folders) to store long, ugly URLs as shortened URLs through our service.

The main goal of this application was to redirect a request at the shortened URL to a user's long URL equivalent. Each shortened URL is belong to a unique folder which is capable of storing "n" URLs.

The secondary goal was to track URL usage and provide popularity statistics.

# _Imposter Syndrome_

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rcwestlake/dockjs)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/imposter-syndrome.html)
* [Live Version Coming...in zip format]

**Description:**<br>

Ryan & Kinan here (creators of DockJS) - We are both motivated to learn more and more Javascript each day, to refine our craft, and garner a deeper understanding of JavaScript's core fundamentals. ScratchJS has always been a great go-to since its release, but we wanted to access a REPL offline from our desktop, and add a few features that take practicing, writing, and learning JavaScript to another level.

In this project, we designed an interpretation of a traditional desktop application using Electron, specifically a JavaScript REPL interface that fully functions offline and can be accessed in the dock in multiple platforms. Since the recent additions to the JavaScript library in ES6/ES7, we wanted to have a feature that allowed a user to upload code in vanilla JS that could be transpiled into ES6 and vice versa.

## D: Professional Skills

### **Gear Up:**

### Tragedy of the Commons

* [Tragedy of the Commons Github Repo](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

Some take aways from this gear-up are that small changes, attitutdes and dispositions can affect the masses at large. This can also be summarized from the following three points, as summarized from the creators of [Parable of the Polygons: A Playable Post on the Shape of Society (PotP)](http://ncase.me/polygons/):

1. Small individual shortcomings lead to large collective failures.
2. Systemic issues from the past are unlikely to be remedied by neutral responses in the present.
3. Small individual "anti-biases" can address systemic biases.

If tech executives (consciously or subconsciously) sought teams in which at least 1/3 of team members are like them (gender, age, race), this may impact the types of jobs available significantly as members of those teams co-create a culture that gradually becomes more similar to them, effecting the level of preference/tolerance/satisfaction of being a minority in those groups enough to repel those who are unlike them (aka diversified) if their majority increases.

Diversity "quotas" are sometimes dismissed as counter-productive or missing the point of actually valuing diversity. PotP does demonstrate how they may add some value. What are your attitudes toward diversity quotas; does this game change your assumptions--one thing I have considered because of PotP is how being unbiased can actually be subtly damaging to diversity as well. If groups are already segregated and are unbiased, they will be completely unmotivated to create initiatives for more diversity. It may be that diversity quotas may be valuable in these types of conditions.

PotP speaks to the power of group norms: a seemingly innocuous attitude, wanting to be surrounded by at least 1/3 of people who look like you, when embraced by a large group, can have huge implications on that community. Considering this reality, the type of knowledge and understandings that Turing should impart to students to ensure they do not enter the field perpetuating ideas that are in conflict with our mission, may be to encourage an attitude of encouraging peers cross-mod to engage and participate in activities aside from the dismay that may be present from gear-ups and spikes not being associated with coding.

###Automation

* [Automation and the Future Github Repo](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

In regards to impact on our economy from now until I 'retire' (which I will never do), automation will have a tremendous effect. From the stock market, grocery checkout, automobiles, serving coffee, and diagnosing disease--to name a few--there has already been a decent sense of automation that has gradually reduced the need for human labor, thus jobs, thus impacting the economic health of indidivuals, who represent the economy. As automation becomes more intelligent, developed, and increases overall in more places, automation will continue to put people out of jobs, especially with machine learning that allows bots to become more intelligent and developed overtime with 'experience' and time.

Across the specturm of people that will be affected by chenges, I am definitely included in the high list since I am entering the professional world of developing software. Indeed, I will be affected by autommation just like most other people will in the developed world since many everyday activities may become increasingly more dependent on automation.

Being a responsible citizen around this issue may mean ensuring that the industries that we automate don't automate at the expense of our quality of life or in ways that become self governing or determine our sovereignty. 

Turing can play a role in advancing civic responsibility in response to the challenges automation will bring by bringing awareness to the inevitability of automation and potential points to consider that will affect NOT JUST our economy but our social dynamics, cultural practices, and general quality of life, psychology, health, and ability to keep this earth clean.

When it comes down to the truth of this matter, wouldn't it be nice to have mundane and creative- soul-draining tasks and occupations obsolete so we may move into a higher sense of being, doing and knowing about ourselves and this world? In many ways, as long as we can control the pathologies of automation, it may actually create a new frontier of experiencing and approaching life that actually increases and connects more people in communities since we do not have to work any longer for ridiculous low wages in the blue-collar world that largely only support the 1% of people in the world that own over 3/4s of our world's wealth.

###Universal Income

* [Universal Income Github Repo](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/universal_basic_income.markdown)

The realities of our future economy most inevitably will be pressing towards a Universally-Based-Income (UBI) with the imminence of automation. As a nation, this may pose issues related to how we may distribute this money, what we will call it, how much it will be, and where it is derived from. 

I think it is inevitable that this occurs, and that Elon Musk is right about saying it is a foregone conclusion, but I'm a little weary about the idea that it will just be given freely without a structure or filter--I'm thinking we are much better off allocating those resources to existing educational institutes, for example, and then giving people 'tokens' or certificates that relate allow people to be motivated away from just dumping money into the economy via consumerism. This is what it means to be a responsible citizen.

## Community

### E: Feedback and Community Participation

#### Being a Community Member

**From Ryan Westlake**:

Working with Kinan was a great experience. I appreciate his methodical approach, which was a nice balance to my work style. We ended with with a very practical and simple Electron app that we're both proud of. My biggest recommendation as he transitions from Turing to the real-world is communication as he thinks through a problem or approach. Can't wait to see where his career takes him.

**From Andrew Crist**: 

Graham and I worked on our very first project together, so it was a long time coming to work again. We definitely felt new again, since we were building a reminder list with a new framework, Ember. We had a hard time learning the ins and outs of the framework, but overall, working together was easygoing. We were able to stay on the same page relatively, and divide and conquer well. I found our collaboration meaningful and successful. If Graham could work on anything, it would be to communicate better while getting stuck. We both may struggle with this, actually. I feel we could just at least work on conjuring up some words into what might be going on and where to go. I will be happy to work with Graham in the future.

**From Ian Lancaster**:

It was great to work with Kinan again on another project. Kinan was a key contributor in our group pairing sessions and was good at keeping the group on track and making sure we take breaks. I especially appreciate Kinan’s attention to detail and ‘see things through’ attitude. This was apparent when he spent a chunk of his weekend polishing the styles of the app and creating a better readme even after the project evel. One thing I think Kinan could work on is making his voice more heard. Kinan is relaxed, respectful, and a great listener but this often leads to others interrupting him and drowning out his voice.

### Playing a Part

**Ways I supported the larger Turing community by:**<br>

Mod 4 is a time in which there is a freedom and responsibility to learn and grow, answer questions, solve problems, and code more independently. This is to ensure a smoother transition post-Turing. 

During this module, we collaborated with Module 3 Front-End in a Design Challenge. This brought new perspectives in and was a unique time to share and interact with another module. I mainly acted as a support for a couple back-end Module 4 folks, answering questions about React and pairing a few times to debug front-end issues. 

Another consistent thread to this module has been the time we have spent interacting with all students from many modules and with other alumni during social fridays at Pourtions. I have definitely met many new people across cohorts and back/front end programs. I believe this is enriching for the Turing community as a whole, since many of us receive great assurance of conditions, confidence in skills, and relief from stress.

##Cold Outreaches

1. EffectiveUI's Dan Saltzman--I spoke to him at the outdoor tech meetup and asked if we could meet for coffee to further discuss an intership or future partnership as I gain more experience. His company is currently setting up a program for shadowing/invitation. He is responding in 1 week.

2. Quantum Metric's Eric Pastuer--I met Eric at a React Meetup. He mentioned they were hiring, and I introduced myself, and sent him a follow-up email. We setup a phone interview, he gave me a code challenge, and I had to decline after discovering the company location of Monument, which I had initially anticipated from our first meeting as Castle Rock, which is already pushing my limitation of a desirable communte time.

3. Gaia's Brian Lynn--is my fiance(Ash)'s friend's husband, who I have never met. I reached out to him one day and asked to meet up for lunch, but we decided it best to have dinner with his wife and Ash. He is a film producer and resides in a separate department, but is now looking to set me up with someone in the developer side of things for lunch--which will be scheduled within the next week.

4. Crew's Michael Cho--As I was read blog posts on Medium one day, I dug in deep. They had some awesome blog posts written, one talking about reaching out and how to get hired. I emailed 2 separate publishers in a format that seemed aligned to their post "how to get hired"--sort of being bold and being clear as they mentioned. I found out later, they are an unmbrella company to UnSplash, which I found Roberta Doyle on, a previous back-end student! Small world of tech at times it feels.

5. Measured Risk's Tim Dugan & Matt Lambert--a friend of mine offered an opportunity with this company that is about to fully take off. They are a start-up. After 2 years, they just received $10MM in funding. I emailed Matt Lambert cold, who is putting me in touch with their HR.

6. Craftsy's Tom Anderson--reached out to this company a couple days ago with mentioning my film background in mind. I haven't heard back from them out yet.

7. ReadyTalk's Colleen Johnson--Read a post by Colleen about Agile Training in Denver that I liked. She no longer works for ReadyTalk, but is currently making a plan for us to meet over coffee to talk about agile in tech and her company ImagineX Consulting.
